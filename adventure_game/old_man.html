		<p>While looking at the painting you lose track of time. It could be mere minutes or hours before you realize you are not the only admirer of the painting. An old man with a twinkle in his eye is standing next to you, staring intently at the painting.</p>
		<p>The old man takes a breath then looks at you. "An old friend of mine adores this painting. His name is Dante Alighieri. However, I have not seen him for some time. You see, he has gone missing. I would go searching for him myself, but age seems to have caught up with me.</p> 
		<p>Would you help me look for him?</p>
